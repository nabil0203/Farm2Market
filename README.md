## Data Models

### `Profile`
Extends Django's built-in `User` model with a role.

| Field              | Type      | Description                          |
|--------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| `user`             | OneToOne  | Linked Django `User`                 |
| `role`             | CharField | `farmer` or `buyer`                  |
| `farm_name`        | CharField | Farmer-only: farm name               |
| `farm_location`    | CharField | Farmer-only: farm location           |
| `bio`              | TextField | Farmer-only: bio                     |
| `delivery_address` | TextField | Buyer-only: delivery address         |

### `Category`
Product categories (created via the admin panel).

### `Product`
Listed by farmers; browsable by buyers.

| Field            | Type         | Description                    |
|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| `farmer`         | ForeignKey   | Owning farmer profile          |
| `category`       | ForeignKey   | Product category               |
| `name`           | CharField    |                                |
| `price_per_unit` | IntegerField | Price in local currency        |
| `stock_quantity` | IntegerField | Available stock                |
| `unit`           | CharField    | e.g., kg, piece                |
| `image`          | ImageField   | Stored under `product_images/` |

### `Cart` / `CartItem`
One cart per buyer. Cart items track quantity and link to products.  
Anonymous users get a **session-based cart** that merges on login.

### `Order` / `OrderItem`
Orders are created per-farmer on checkout with a price snapshot.

**Order Status Flow:**
```
PENDING → CONFIRMED → ASSIGNED → OUT_FOR_DELIVERY → DELIVERED → COMPLETED
                                                              ↗
PENDING → REJECTED
PENDING → CANCELLED (by buyer)
```

### `Logistic`
Delivery service providers (e.g., Pathao, Steadfast) — assigned by farmers at the `CONFIRMED` stage.

### `Notification`
Per-user, per-order messages surfaced via context processors as navbar badges.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Farm2Market
```

### 2. Create & activate a virtual environment

```bash
py -m venv my_env
my_env\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Navigate to the directory containing `manage.py`:

```bash
cd Farm2Market
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

Copy the example file and fill in your values:

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname
```

> **Tip:** Leave `DATABASE_URL` unset to use a local SQLite database for development.

### 5. Download media files

Download the `media/` folder from:  
📁 [Google Drive – Media Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gz0SvMe0pYM71-PdeljfQt_BYKn3_1tH)

Place it in the same directory as `manage.py` (`Farm2Market/media/`).

### 6. Run migrations

```bash
# First-time or after model changes:
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# If models are unchanged:
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. Create a superuser

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 8. (Optional) Add categories and logistics via Admin

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` to:
